### Question 2
I got this question wrong because i didn't know default values can be included in prompt statements. The question asked to prompt the user to ask to enter the number of hours the user they work in a week, to set a default value to be pre-populated with the value 40, and to store the user's response in a variable named 'hours'. The correct answer was a prompt with the specifics of the questions and saved under the 'hours' variable. It also puts the default value of 40 after the written prompt, which I didn't know could be done.
