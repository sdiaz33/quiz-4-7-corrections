# Quiz 4-7 Corrections

## Quiz 4
### Question 2
I got this question wrong because I didn't know default values can be included in prompt statements. The question asked to prompt the user to ask to enter the number of hours the user they work in a week, to set a default value to be pre-populated with the value 40, and to store the user's response in a variable named `hours`. The correct answer was a prompt with the specifics of the questions and saved under the `hours` variable. It also puts the default value of 40 after the written prompt, which I didn't know could be done.  

### Question 7
I got points off of this question because it asked to select all that apply and I missed a few correct answers and chose a few incorrect answers. Therefore the question asked to choose all the following valid data types in Javascript and I chose `boolean`, `object`, `integer`, `number`, `string`, `character`, and `symbol`, but only 5 out these 7 were correct. Two of which I chose, `integer` and `character`, were incorrect and instead I should've chosen `undefined` and `null`. 

### Question 9
For this question, I didn't get anything wrong, but I still got points off because it was a select all that apply question and I missed two correct answers. The question asked to select the following values that are always considered falsey and I chose `null`, `undefined`, `false`, and `NaN`. The correct answers I missed were `""` and `0`. 

### Question 10
This question asked to declare and initialize a variable called `x` with the value 27. I got this question wrong because I didn't know the difference between declaring and initializing so I selected the answer that only initializes the variable with the correct value, but doesn't declare it. The correct answer is the following:
```
let x;
x = 27;
```

### Question 11
This was a programming question for which I lost only a few points, but I could not open the file on my chromebook, so I don't know what were my mistakes. I'm sure my mistakes were minor and related to the execution of the code.
